Welcome to the introductory material on infectious disease modelling in R for 5-day course on "Modelling infectious Diseases and Health Economics" as part of the Antwerp Summer University. The tutorials are based a work from Sebastian Funk, Gwen Knight and Anton Camacho from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. We fully acknowledge their work and are thankfull for making them open-source via [GitHub](https://github.com/sbfnk/modelling).

## Required software
* [R](http://cran.r-project.org) is used as the main programming language. Please install at least version: R-3.5.0.
* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (recommended) is a popular graphic user interface (GUI).
